# Mini project: Vietnam Population Dashboard 

Visualize Vietnam population changes from 2011 to 2024. Data from the the [National Statistics Office of Vietnam](https://www.nso.gov.vn/px-web-2/?pxid=V0201&theme=D%C3%A2n%20s%E1%BB%91%20v%C3%A0%20lao%20%C4%91%E1%BB%99ng).

Heavy inspiration from Streamlit [guide](https://blog.streamlit.io/crafting-a-dashboard-app-in-python-using-streamlit/) to making good dashboard.

# 1. Key metrics 

There are 3 metrics considered:
1. How do total populations compare among different provinces?
-> 

2. How do state populations evolve over time and how do they compare to each other?
-> 

3. In a given year, which provinces experienced more than 50,000 people moving in, or out? 
-> 


# 2. Data processing 

Text encoding errors are fixed by hands and additional pre-processing is done using `pandas`.
